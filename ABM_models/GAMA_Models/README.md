# GAMA Agent-based Models

This folder contains a set of work in progress ABMs of a city with spatial layers of the build environment, transport network and destinations, as well as a representative synthetic agent population that displays mobility behavior and does choices depending on the individual and environmental context. Additionally spatial layers of environmental stressors are joint with the spatiotemporally dynamic location of the individuals to approximate exposure.

The simulation experiments in the folder **Urban Exposure Transport Intervention ABMs** simulate Amsterdam and for now a set of simple transport interventions.
